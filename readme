In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

I used AI to help me understand gdb and how bugs related trees may 
manifest through gdb. In addition, I used AI to understand the current 
invariants and how they may manifest for files instead of directories.
However, I did not use it to generate any ideas, code, or concepts 
directly related to completing the assignment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Yes, it was a very involved assignment that helped us understand how to
debug code using gdb. Assignment felt very practical, but quite tedious.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Yes, it was helpful and fun.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express

   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?

   ft.c: line 425: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

We intentionally do not assert that these pointers are non-NULL,
because a file in the FT may have NULL contents to represent an 
empty file.

   Do you want to validate 'contents' through an assert?

   nodeFT.c: line 268: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'newContents' through an assert?

We intentionally do not assert that these pointers are non-NULL,
because a file in the FT may have NULL contents to represent an

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insert

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
